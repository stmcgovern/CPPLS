This is the Coupled Parallel Pressure Level Set application. 
It is based on the finite element library deal.II. It uses MPI with PETSc. 

The LevelSetSolver class was written by Manuel Quezada de Luna, from the deal.II
code gallery's "two-phase flow" application, and adapted for use in the current 
context of sedimentary basin modeling.
